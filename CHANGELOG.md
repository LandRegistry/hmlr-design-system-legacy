(_Feel free to re-add if your app needs it, but for new applications please favour vanilla JS where feasible._)</li><li>land-registry-elements and govuk-elements-jinja-macros dependencies temporarily removed while these are ported to new kit (To be re-added in a future release). Note: *Any teams already using these would be better to wait for this subsequent release*</li><li>Gulp tasks and package.json tweaked to build new kit</li><li>New GOV.UK documentation can be found here: https://hmlr-design-system.service.gov.uk/</li></ul>| [Here](http://git.dev.ctp.local/skeletons/hmlr-design-system/merge_requests/25) |

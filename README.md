# hmlr-design-system

## Approach to common patterns

- Regular review of proposed patterns
- Multiple avenues in? Could be a sketch on a bit of paper for an initial idea, or a component that is actually already live in a service

## Contribution process

Broadly propose that we follow a similar process to https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/propose-a-component-or-pattern/

- Initial idea
- Prototype
- Reviewed and discussed - either return to the prototyping phase, or continue
- Creation of production ready version
- Create demos and documentation on the design system homepage
- Schedule a post implementation review - how's it going 6 months later?


## Technical approach

- Target platforms. Python/flask (Jinja) and React? Any others? And how do we handle this?
- Prototype kit
- Axure
